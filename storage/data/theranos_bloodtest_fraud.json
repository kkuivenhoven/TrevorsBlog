        "explanation": "Exaggerating your device’s capabilities to attract investors is a risky move. As an investigator, I would note this raises ethical red flags. Misleading claims could lead to securities fraud charges if exposed, inviting SEC scrutiny. Patient safety risks amplify potential legal consequences."

        "next_id": 3,
        "explanation": "Dismissing early employee concerns prioritizes image over accuracy. As an investigator, I would flag this as a warning sign. Ignoring issues, as Holmes did, risks internal dissent and potential whistleblower leaks, setting the stage for regulatory or media scrutiny."
